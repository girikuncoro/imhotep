# Documentation

## TLDR;
* Documentation is a first class citizen
* Use ExampleXXX to denote a code sample to add to your code Documentation
* Examples are also tests!

## Code

```go
func ExampleFred() {
    fmt.Println(BumbleBeeTuna(2))
    // Output:
    // BumbleBeeTuna, two times!
}

## Package docs

```shell
godoc -http :3000
```

## Your turn...

### Lab1.6 ![alt text](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon24.png "Lab1.6") 
---

### Mission
> Remember your FizzBuzz lab?
> Use your FizzBuzz implementation and convert it to a package to share with the rest
> of the GO community (No pressure right?)

### Hints

o Create a fizzbuzz directory in your $GOPATH/src/github.com/YOUR_USER_NAME
o Create calc.go calc_test.go
o In your test make sure you use the fizzbuzz_test package as you will need to export your calculator

### Checklist

To prepare for that make sure your **fizzbuzz** package is:
* Fully tested and a 100% covered using the table test technique 
* Fully documented
* Benchmarked

### Reminders

```shell
go test                                      # Runs your tests
go test -coverprofile cov.out                # Generates coverage info
go tool cover -func cov.out                  # Generate coverage report
go test -v --run xxx -bench Bench --benchmem # Running Benchmarks
godoc -http :3000                            # Check your docs
```
