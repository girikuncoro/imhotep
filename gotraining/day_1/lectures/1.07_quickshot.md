# Quick Shot

Need to inject some knowledge here before we move on to the testing section.
We will look at these in more details in the very near future...

## UserDefined Type

### TLDR;

* GO provide a type construct to allow a user to define her own types

### Example

```go
// Defined a user-defined type named person with 2 attributes namely name and age for type string and int
type person struct {
    name string
    age  int
}

// Create an instance of the person type and initialize it
f := fred{"Fernand", 30}

// To access the attributes of the type use the '.' operator
f.name // => Fernand
f.age  // => 30
```

## Array

### TLDR;
* Arrays is a collection type
* They contain elements of the same type
* Static memory foot print ie once initialized their size will never vary.  
* Indexing an array is zero based
* The length of an array is accessed via the len built-in function

```go
  // Defines a zero value array with 2 elements
  // Zero value of string is ""
  b := [2]string{} // # => ["", ""]

  // Defines an array with 3 elements
  a := [3]int{1, 2, 3}

  // To access an element use the [] operator
  a[0] // => 1

  // To update an element use the [] operator
  a[0] = 10
  fmt.Println(a[0]) # => 10
```

## For loop

### TLDR;
* Control shape is Pre; Test; Post
* Pre, Test and Post operations are optional
* Loop variables are scoped to the loop body
* Can use range built-in function. range takes in a collection and return an index and a value

### Example

```go
   // Loops from 0 to 9, inc i at each iteration
   for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
       fmt.Println(i)
   }  

   for i, value := range myArray {
       fmt.Println(i, value)
   }
```

## If Statement

### TLDR;
* uses bool operators ==, !=, <, >, >=
* uses logical and/or &&, ||
* Formatting is important!

### Example

```go 
   if i == 20 and j == 0 {
       ...
   } else if j >= 30 {
       ...
   } else {
       ...
   }
```

### Mission

> Mission: Game of Thrones is all about castles and minions.
> At any point in time, kings and queens want to know which minions are
> in a given castle. Write a function that takes two arguments, an array 
> of castles and an array of minions and returns an array. The returned array 
> is a representation of {castle, minion} tuples. This technic is called array zipping.
> You can make the assumption that both array are of the same size.

## Expectations

[{"Castle Black", "melissandre"}, {"Red Keep", "Jon Snow"}, {"DragonStone", "Kal Drogo"}]
