# Benchmarking

## TLDR;
* Checking that your code runs a fast as possible should always be on your mind. 
* GO provides support for measuring your implementations.
* Use BenchmarkXXX to indicate benchmarking tests
* During the test b.N is adjusted to ensure the measurement is reliable. 
* The default run time is 1s and can be adjusted via the --benchtime

## Example

```go
func BenchmarkTest(b *testing.B) {
    for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {
        runMyTest(b)
    }
}
```

## Running Benchmarks

```shell
go test --run xxx -bench Greet
go test --run xxx -bench Greet --benchmem
```
