# Visibility

Until now we've been mainly staying in main and the playground.
Hence visibility did not matter much. 
Let's take a closer look by writing a library...

## TLDR;

* GO supports exported/nonexported also know as public/private
* Applies to functions and any types include user-defined attributes 
* Exported entities start with an uppercase
* Unexported start with a lowercase
